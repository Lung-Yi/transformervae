# Research Findings: TransformerVAE Modular Architecture

## Overview
This document consolidates research findings for implementing a modular, configuration-driven TransformerVAE architecture for molecular generation.

## Configuration Management

### Decision: YAML + Dataclass Configuration System
- **Rationale**: YAML provides human-readable configuration format with excellent Python tooling support. Dataclasses with type hints ensure type safety and validation at parse time.
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - JSON: Less readable for complex configurations
  - TOML: Good for simple configs but less suitable for nested model architectures
  - Python files: Flexible but harder to validate and version

### Implementation Pattern
- Use `dataclasses` with `@dataclass` decorator for configuration structures
- Implement YAML loader with type validation using `dataclasses-json` or custom loader
- Separate configuration schemas for model architecture, training parameters, and dataset settings

## PyTorch Architecture Patterns

### Decision: Factory Pattern for Layer Creation
- **Rationale**: Enables dynamic layer instantiation from configuration strings while maintaining type safety and extensibility.
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Direct instantiation: Less flexible for configuration-driven approach
  - Registry pattern: More complex but considered for future extensibility

### Layer Abstraction Strategy
- Define abstract base classes for each layer type (Encoder, Decoder, Sampler)
- Use `torch.nn.Module` inheritance with consistent interfaces
- Implement `build_from_config()` class methods for configuration-driven instantiation

## Molecular Data Processing

### Decision: SMILES Tokenization with RDKit Integration
- **Rationale**: SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) is standard for molecular representation. RDKit provides robust molecular manipulation and validation.
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - SELFIES: More robust but less established in existing datasets
  - Graph representations: More complex and beyond current scope

### Dataset Handling
- Support both MOSES and ZINC-15 datasets with unified interface
- Implement configurable preprocessing pipelines
- Use lazy loading for memory efficiency with large datasets

## Training Infrastructure

### Decision: Modular Trainer with Callback System
- **Rationale**: Separates training logic from model definition, enables flexible experiment configuration and monitoring.
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Lightning integration: Adds dependency overhead for current requirements
  - Custom training loops: More control but less standardized

### Evaluation Metrics
- Implement standard molecular generation metrics: Validity, Uniqueness, Novelty, FCD
- Support configurable evaluation schedules and checkpointing
- Integrate with logging systems (TensorBoard, Weights & Biases optional)

## Type Safety Implementation

### Decision: Comprehensive Type Hints with Runtime Validation
- **Rationale**: Aligns with constitution requirements for type safety while enabling early error detection.
- **Implementation approach**:
  - Use `typing` module for complex type annotations
  - Implement runtime validation in configuration parsing
  - Use `mypy` for static type checking in development

## Testing Strategy

### Decision: Pytest with Fixture-Based Architecture
- **Rationale**: Pytest provides excellent fixture system for ML testing scenarios with complex data dependencies.
- **Testing layers**:
  - Unit tests: Individual components (layers, configuration parsing)
  - Integration tests: End-to-end training workflows
  - Contract tests: Configuration schema validation

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Management
- Implement batch processing with configurable batch sizes
- Use gradient accumulation for effective large batch training
- Support mixed precision training (optional)

### GPU Acceleration
- Automatic device detection and configuration
- Support for multi-GPU training (future consideration)
- Fallback to CPU when GPU unavailable

## Research Reproducibility

### Decision: Comprehensive Experiment Tracking
- **Rationale**: Essential for research validity and reproducibility as mandated by constitution.
- **Implementation**:
  - Configuration versioning with git hashes
  - Deterministic random seed management
  - Model checkpoint versioning with metadata
  - Experiment result logging with full configuration snapshots

## Dependencies and Version Management

### Core Dependencies
- **PyTorch 2.0+**: Latest stable with improved performance and type annotations
- **RDKit**: Standard for molecular operations and SMILES processing
- **PyYAML**: Configuration file parsing
- **NumPy/SciPy**: Numerical operations and scientific computing
- **pytest**: Testing framework

### Optional Dependencies
- **TensorBoard**: Training visualization
- **tqdm**: Progress bars for long-running operations
- **matplotlib/seaborn**: Result visualization

## Migration Strategy

### Backward Compatibility
- Maintain original model architecture interfaces
- Provide configuration templates that reproduce original behavior
- Implement validation against original performance benchmarks

### Incremental Deployment
1. Phase 1: Configuration system and base layers
2. Phase 2: Model integration and training pipeline
3. Phase 3: Evaluation and testing infrastructure
4. Phase 4: Documentation and examples

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Configuration complexity**: Mitigate with comprehensive validation and examples
- **Performance regression**: Continuous benchmarking against original implementation
- **Type safety overhead**: Use runtime validation judiciously, rely on static checking

### Research Risks
- **Reproducibility**: Implement comprehensive experiment tracking from day one
- **Backward compatibility**: Maintain original interfaces and provide migration path
