## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a machine learning researcher working with molecular generation models, I need a highly configurable TransformerVAE implementation that allows me to easily experiment with different architectural configurations and training parameters without modifying code, so that I can efficiently conduct research and compare model variants.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a researcher wants to experiment with different encoder architectures, **When** they modify the configuration file to specify different layer types and dimensions, **Then** the system creates and trains a model with the specified architecture without code changes
2. **Given** a researcher wants to train on different datasets, **When** they specify the dataset type in the configuration, **Then** the system loads and processes the appropriate dataset (MOSES or ZINC-15)
3. **Given** a researcher wants to tune hyperparameters, **When** they modify training configuration parameters, **Then** the system applies these parameters during training and evaluation
4. **Given** a trained model exists, **When** a researcher wants to evaluate generation quality, **Then** the system provides metrics including validity, novelty, and FCD scores
5. **Given** a researcher wants to reproduce experiments, **When** they use the same configuration file, **Then** the system produces consistent results across runs

### Edge Cases
- What happens when configuration parameters are invalid or inconsistent?
- How does system handle memory constraints with large model configurations?
- What happens when dataset files are missing or corrupted?
- How does system behave when GPU is unavailable but CUDA is enabled in config?
